 building_castle_04:1 "Кёдзё"
 building_castle_04_desc:1 "A massive castle in contrast to the transitory nature of the human. Historically, Odawara Castle was a symbol of the authority of the Go-Hojo clan, Azuchi Castle changed the role of castles in later times because of its eccentricity, and Osaka Castle showed the prestige of the unifier of Japan. These castles have fallen, and we hope that this one will not suffer the same fate."

 building_outposts_02:1 "Доруй"
 building_outposts_02_desc:1 "They were just piles of earth, but it was surprisingly tricky for soldiers in armor to climb up and down them. Furthermore, low but solid earthen mounds are more effective against bullets and shells than high, thin walls."

 building_outposts_06:1 "Frontier Fort"
 building_outposts_06_desc:1 "They are fortifications to spy on the enemy territory. Some of them were Tsukejiro built near the enemy's castle to seize the enemy territory. For example, Oda Nobunaga formed a siege network of forts such as Marune Fort and Washizu Fort to pressure the Imagawa clan's Odaka Castle, which led to the Battle of Okehazama."
 building_outposts_07:1 "Добэй"

 building_type_hill_forts_01:0 "Ямадзиро"
 building_type_hill_forts_01_desc:1 "The Kamakura period (1185-1333) was the era of horsemen. In the turbulent period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, samurai built defensive facilities in the mountains to kill the horsemen's momentum. From then on, the Yama-jiro (mountain castle) became the mainstay of \"castles\" for a long time. The effect was so significant that warriors who wore heavily armored large armor had a hard time attacking and had to reduce the weight of their armor."
 building_hill_forts_01:1 "Цумэ-дзиро"
 building_hill_forts_01_desc:1 "No lord would want to live on top of a steep mountain. However, flatlands are weak in defense. Therefore, in times of peace, they would live in their residence at the foot of the hill, and when the enemy attacked them, they would take refuge in the Tsume-jiro (backup castle) that rose behind them. At that point, it would be his final home."
 building_hill_forts_02:1 "Коси-курува"
 building_hill_forts_02_desc:1 "Koshi-kuruwa is a long, narrow bailey on the mountain face along the summit. Defenders used them to shoot at enemy soldiers coming up the slope. Kan'nonji Castle, the residence of the Rokkaku clan, was built of stone from early on and had more than 1,000 baileys."
 building_hill_forts_03:1 "Кара-бори"
 building_hill_forts_03_desc:1 "Kara-bori (Dry moat) is essential in limiting the entry of the enemy. Horizontal moats, dug along the periphery of the bailey, blocked the enemy, while vertical trenches dug into the slope restricted the enemy's path of entry. These various types of moats decorated the mountain castle. The Shōji-bori of the Go-Hojo clan is well known."
 building_hill_forts_04:1 "Хёро-ко"
 building_hill_forts_04_desc:1 "No matter how well defended the mountain castle was, the food supply situation was not good because there were no fields nearby. If we build a Hyōrō-ko (food warehouse) and fill it with rice, the besieging army will starve first."
 building_hill_forts_05:1 "Киригиси"
 building_hill_forts_05_desc:1 "Kirigishi (cliff) is a slope carved out of the mountain surface. It was too steep for enemy soldiers to climb. There was not even a blade of grass on the cliff, forcing the enemy soldiers to give up climbing. However, if the defenders cut the slope too far, it would cause a cliff to collapse, sending them on top into the abyss."
 building_hill_forts_06:1 "Ō-ягура"
 building_hill_forts_06_desc:1 "A large, sturdy wooden Yagura (tower). Although it is vulnerable to fire arrows, arrows and bullets fired from here will send enemy soldiers into the abyss."
 building_hill_forts_07:1 "Исигаки"
 building_hill_forts_07_desc:1 "Stone walls on a mountain slope or bank.

 building_type_curtain_walls_01:1 "Хирадзиро"
 building_type_curtain_walls_01_desc:1 "Building castles on the plains was not a highly praised practice. There was no difference in elevation that would kill the momentum of the cavalry or give them an advantage in battle. However, they were convenient for transportation. With the development of castle-building technology, castles became the mainstream from the end of the Oribe period to the Edo period, not for warfare but control."
 building_curtain_walls_01:1 "Тати"
 building_curtain_walls_01_desc:1 "A residence of samurai in the Kamakura period.

 building_curtain_walls_05_desc:1 "The entrance to a castle. The defenders partition the entry by two gates and place the gates to bend around bridges and roads. In this way, they improve the entrance to kill the attacking enemy's momentum and target the enemy soldiers from multiple directions."
 building_curtain_walls_06:1 "Санмару"
 building_curtain_walls_06_desc:1 "The new bailey follows Ni-no-maru (second bailey). The shape of the castle becomes more complicated depending on how they place the third bailey. It is near the center of the court, the second bailey. So the residences of the chief retainers are lined up here."
 building_curtain_walls_07:1 "Исигаки"
 building_curtain_walls_07_desc:1 "Stone walls on a mountain slope or bank. They made it possible to build artificial high ground, which significantly increased the usefulness of castles on the plains. It became possible to form large castle towns by building castles on the flatland along the roads rather than on the mountains where it was difficult for people to come and go. Large castle towns attracted a lot of money and made the castles larger and more luxurious."
 building_curtain_walls_08:1 "Суми-ягура"
 building_curtain_walls_08_desc:1 "It is a sturdy turret built in the corner of the bailey. From there, you can see the bridge and road leading to the gate, allowing you to attack the incoming enemy from the side."

 building_ramparts_03:1 "Хори"
 building_ramparts_03_desc:1 "It is essential in limiting the enemy's entry. If there were a water source nearby, it would be a water moat. If not, defenders would dig an empty trench (Yagenbori) at a sharp angle to prevent the enemy from quickly crossing."
 building_ramparts_04:1 "Ягура"

 building_ramparts_08:1 "Умадаси"
 building_ramparts_08_desc:1 "A small bailey, built around the front of the gate with earthworks, prevents the enemy from attacking the entrance from the front. If the enemy tried to attack the Umadashi, they would expose their flank to the walls, and if they tried to retreat, defenders scattered coming out of the Umadashi. Sanadamaru, built at the Hiranokuchi of Osaka Castle during the Osaka Winter Campaign, can be an enlarged version of Umadashi. With its earthworks and boarding fences, the Sanadamaru protected the gorgeous Osaka Castle with its stone and earthen walls."

However, the sanitary conditions on the reclaiming east side of Edo were poor."
 building_watchtowers_05:1 "Тамон-ягура"
 building_watchtowers_05_desc:1 "Tamon Turret is a turret at Tamon-Yama Castle in Yamato Province under Matsunaga Hisahide. It is a fusion of a turret and a row house, a soldiers' quarter.

 building_watchtowers_06:1 "Со-гамаэ"
 building_watchtowers_06_desc:1 "This structure enclosed the castle and the town with moats and earthen mounds, making it possible to withstand a prolonged siege. Odawara Castle, the main castle of the Go-Hojo clan, and Osaka Castle, the main castle of the Toyotomi clan, are particularly famous. Still, Ishiyama Honganji Temple and Sakai's self-governing city also had the same structure."

 building_guild_halls_01:0 "Sansai Markets"
 building_guild_halls_01_desc:0 "Markets were held only three times a month in the Kamakura period (1185-1333). Therefore, when the market was not open, the temporary stalls often became a home for crows and wild dogs."

 building_guild_halls_05_desc:1 "They were merchants who had close personal relationships with feudal lords. They were trusted as reliable business partners, purchased and sold provisions and armor, and managed trade. Imai Sokyu ran Egoshu (the self-governing organization of Sakai) under Oda Nobunaga, and Chaya Shirojiro (Kiyonobu), a wealthy merchant in Kyoto, continued to support Tokugawa Ieyasu. They kept the country's unification under the banner of feudal lords, not through military power but the power of money."

The powerful feudal lord's management of their territories created a situation where merchants could sell goods at the market without relying on the guilds. The feudal lords who wanted to keep the new merchants on their side dismantled the guilds."
